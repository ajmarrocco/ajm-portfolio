            <p>Aspiring software engineer with a background in mechanical engineering and physics. Currently in a
                program to receive certification in Full Stack Web Development - Coding from Columbia University,
                expected to graduate in May 2022. Skills include JavaScript, Node.js, Jest, Express.js, Inquirer.js,
                ORM, OOP and TDD. Recently, I applied my knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, Jest, and Inquirer.js, to
                create a program that generates an HTML with a team's basic information so the manager has easy access
                to their emails and GitHub profiles. For each project, I employ my analytical skills in concert with my
                ability to work through every detail. A project is never complete until it undergoes a close review for
                ease of use and an impactful user experience. The goal of each project is to use my skills to create a
                well thought out and engaging application. As a team player with a strong work ethic, I have a great
                desire to utilize my skills in an accelerating, motivated team in the software engineering field to
                further my knowledge as well as provide a new perspective of the current task.</p>
